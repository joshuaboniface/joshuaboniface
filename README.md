### Hello, I'm Joshua Boniface

You may remember me from such successful projects as [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin) and [Parallel Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/parallelvirtualcluster).

By day, I'm a Senior Systems Architect (a.k.a. Sysadmin, DevOps Engineer, and Python developer all rolled into one fun package).

By night, I contribute to several open source projects. I lead the [Jellyfin Project](https://jellyfin.org) and my own [Parallel Virtual Cluster](https://docs.parallelvirtualcluster.org) HCI manager solution, as well as many other small projects that tickle my fancy. Check below for some of the more interesting ones.

When I'm not contributing, I'm usually geeking out, drumming, gardening, or biking. I'm a big fan of (big shock) Star Trek, Magic: The Gathering, and tabletop gaming. Currently trying to find a decent TNG-era Engineering/Ops uniform.
